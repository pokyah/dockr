Description: Build a lightweight Docker base R container image for your R 
    package, in which the package itself is available. The Docker image seeks 
    to mirror your R session as close as possible with respect to R specific 
    dependencies. Both dependencies on CRAN R packages as well as local non-CRAN 
    R packages will be included in the Docker container image.
