Description: A small toolkit to create a minimal Docker image for an R package. 
   The package dependencies are identified and set in the Dockerfile, such that 
   they reflect the exact versions in the present R session. Hence the Docker 
   image will mirror the current session.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.0)
