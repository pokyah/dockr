# dockr

`dockr` 0.8.0 is now available on CRAN. `dockr` is a minimal toolkit to build a 
lightweight Docker image from your R package, in which the package itself is 
installed and available. The image seeks to mirror your R session as close as 
possible with respect to R specific dependencies.

## Installation

Install the development version of `dockr` with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("smaakage85/dockr")
```

Or install the version released on CRAN: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("dockr")
```

# 

```{r setup}
library(dockr)
```
