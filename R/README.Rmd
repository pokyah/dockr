`dockr` is a lightweight toolkit to validate new observations when computing
their corresponding predictions with a predictive model.

With `dockr` the validation process consists of two steps:

1. record relevant statistics and meta data of the variables in the original
training data for the predictive model
2. use these data to run a set of basic validation tests on the new set of
observations.

## Motivation

There can be many data specific reasons, why you might not be confident in the
predictions of a predictive model on new data.
