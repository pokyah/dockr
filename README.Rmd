[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smaakage85/dockr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smaakage85/dockr)
[![CRAN\_Release\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version-ago/dockr)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dockr) [![CRAN\_Download\_Badge](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/dockr)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dockr)

`dockr` is a lightweight toolkit to build a lightweight Docker container image 
for your R package, in which the package itself is available. The Docker image 
seeks to mirror your R session as close as possible with respect to R specific 
dependencies. Both dependencies on CRAN R packages as well as local non-CRAN R 
packages will be included in the Docker container image.

## Installation

Install the development version of `dockr` with:

```{r install_github, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("smaakage85/dockr")
```

Or install the version released on CRAN: 

```{r install_cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("dockr")
```

## Workflow

In order do create the files, that constitute the Docker image, simply invoke 
the `prepare_docker_image()` function and point to the folder with your package. 

The workflow of `prepare_docker_image()` is summarized below:

1. Build and install the package on your system
2. Identify R package dependencies of the package
3. Detect the version numbers of the loaded and installed versions of these 
packages on your system
4. Write Dockerfile and create all other files needed to build the Docker image

Now, I will let `dockr` do its magic and create the files for a Docker image
container, in which `dockr` is installed together with all of the R package 
dependencies, `dockr` needs to run.

Beware that the files are created as side-effects of the function call.

```{r create_image, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dockr)
image_dockr <- prepare_docker_image(".")
```

Great, all necessary files for the Docker image have been created, and you 
can build the Docker image right away by following the instructions. It is as 
easy as that! Yeah!

## What about non-R dependencies?

`dockr` does _not_ deal with any non-R dependencies what so ever at this point. 
In case that, for instance, your package has any Linux specific dependencies, 
you will have to install them yourself in the Docker container image.

I hope, that you will find `dockr` useful.
