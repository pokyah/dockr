This is a resubmission.

I fixed the warning and have provided a couple of examples for exported functions. 
I have set the examples to "\donttest", since the only outputs from the functions are
side effects. Also I have written a couple of unit tests.

## R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Other tests passed
- Travis CI
- rhub::check_for_cran() (0 errors, 0 warnings)
