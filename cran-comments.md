This is the first release of 'dockr'.

## R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Other tests passed
- Travis CI
- rhub::check_for_cran() (0 errors, 1 warnings, 0 notes): Warning: "No examples,
no tests, no vignettes". I find it quite hard to write proper unit tests for the
package, since the output consists almost solely of side effects. I have carried
out a lot of manual tests of the package myself. What is your opinion on this?
